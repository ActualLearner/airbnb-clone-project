## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.
  
## Objectives
- Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
- Deepen understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
- Implement advanced security measures for API development.
- Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
- Strengthen ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
- Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.
  
## Team Roles
**Backend Developer:** Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.  
**Database Administrator:** Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.  
**DevOps Engineer:** Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.  
**QA Engineer:** Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.  
  
## Technology Stack
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
  
## Database Design
### Entites and Relationships
#### 1. Users:  
- id: unique identifer
- name: full name of the user
- email:
- password_hash:
- role:
> A user can have multiple properties, bookings, payments and reviews.

#### 2. Properties
- **id**: Unique identifier
- **owner_id**: Foreign key to Users (host)
- **title**: Property title
- **description**: Property details
- **location**: Address or city  
> A property belongs to one user and can have many bookings and reviews.

#### 3. Bookings
- **id**: Unique identifier
- **user_id**: Foreign key to Users (guest)
- **property_id**: Foreign key to Properties
- **start_date**: Start of booking
- **end_date**: End of booking  
> A booking links a guest to a property.

#### 4. Reviews
- **id**: Unique identifier
- **user_id**: Foreign key to Users (reviewer)
- **property_id**: Foreign key to Properties
- **rating**: Score (1–5)
- **comment**: Written feedback  
> A review is made by a user for a property.

#### 5. Payments
- **id**: Unique identifier
- **booking_id**: Foreign key to Bookings
- **amount**: Total amount paid
- **payment_method**: e.g., credit card, PayPal
- **status**: e.g., pending, completed  
> Each payment is tied to a booking.

## Feature Breakdown  
1. **User Management:** Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.  
2. **Property Management:** Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. **Booking System:** Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4. **Payment Processing:** Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5. **Review System:** Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. **Data Optimization:** Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## API Security

### Authentication
User identity is verified using secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based login systems. This ensures that only authorized users can access protected resources.

### Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that guests and hosts can only perform actions relevant to their roles (e.g., only hosts can create listings).

### Rate Limiting
Prevents abuse by restricting how often clients can make API requests. This helps defend against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts.

### Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data is validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure API endpoints receive clean, expected data.

### Data Encryption
Sensitive information like passwords is hashed using strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt), and data in transit is encrypted via HTTPS.

## CI/CD Pipeline

A continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is a series of established steps that developers must follow in order to deliver a new version of software. CI/CD pipelines are a practice focused on improving software delivery throughout the software development life cycle via automation.

By automating CI/CD throughout development, testing, production, and monitoring phases of the software development lifecycle, teams are able to develop higher quality code, faster and more securely. Automated testing also allows dependencies and other issues to be identified earlier in the software development lifecycle, saving time later. Although it’s possible to manually execute each of the steps of a CI/CD pipeline, the true value of CI/CD pipelines is realized through automation.

Popular tools include Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, and GitHub Actions, each offering features like automated builds, testing, and deployment to different environments.
