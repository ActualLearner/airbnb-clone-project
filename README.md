## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.

## Objectives
- Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
- Deepen understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
- Implement advanced security measures for API development.
- Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
- Strengthen ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
- Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.

## Technology Stack
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Team Roles
**Backend Developer:** Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.  
**Database Administrator:** Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.  
**DevOps Engineer:** Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
